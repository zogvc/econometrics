# Econometrics

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️**

Notes and codes on Econometric methods.

Python will be the primary programming language I will use for the model implementation.

Others include Matlab and Stata.

Datasets for empirical analysis can be downloaded at [https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

## Contents

This repository is mainly divided into three parts: `notes`, `codes`, and `appendix`.

- `notes` include lecture notes on various topics in econometric theory.
- `codes` include programming codes that implement econometric methods **from scratch**.
- `empirical-analysis` include data work
- `stata` includes guides to basic syntax of Stata for beginners. (Tutorials on Python, Matlab, and Julia can be found at my `numerical-methods` repository.)
- `appendix` is for the mathematical completeness of the notes. While we go through important features of mathematical tools in `notes`, for more detailed description you can refer to `appendix`. 

Below is the list of topics covered (or to be upated) in each section.

### Notes

- Conditional Expectation Function and Projection
- Least Squares Regression

### Codes

- Least Squares (`01_least_squares.ipynb`)

### Empirics

- CPS (`cps.ipynb`)

### Appendix

- Matrix Algebra
