# Econometrics

Notes and codes on Econometric methods.

Python will be the primary programming language I will use for the implementation.

Others include Matlab and Stata.

Datasets for empirical analysis can be downloaded at [https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

## Contents

This repository is mainly divided into three parts: `notes`, `codes`, `empirics` and `appendix`.

- `notes` include notes on various topics in econometric theory.
- `codes` include programming codes that implement econometric methods.
- `empirics` 
- `appendix` is for the mathematical completeness of the notes. While we go through important features of mathematical tools in `notes`, for more detailed description you can refer to `appendix`. 

Below is the list of topics covered (or to be upated) in each section.

### Notes

- Conditional Expectation Function and Projection
- Least Squares Regression

### Codes

- Least Squares

### Empirics

### Appendix

- Matrix Algebra
