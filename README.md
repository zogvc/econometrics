# Econometrics

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️**

Notes and codes on Econometric methods including machine learning techniques.

Python will be the primary programming language I will use for the model implementation. Others include Matlab and Stata.

Datasets for empirical analysis can be downloaded at [https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

All errors are my own.

## Contents

This repository is mainly divided into four parts: `notes`, `codes`, `empirical analysis` and `stata`.

- `notes` include course notes on various topics in econometric theory.
- `codes` include programming codes that implement econometric methods **from scratch**.
- `empirical-analysis` include data work.
- `stata` includes guides to basic syntax of Stata for beginners. (Tutorials on Python, Matlab, and Julia can be found at my `numerical-methods` repository.)

Below is the list of topics covered (or to be updated) in each section.

### Notes

### Codes
